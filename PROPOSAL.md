# Project Proposal
For my project proposal, I was thinking about creating a fitness app that you could enter information, and it would return fitness information for the person with other features.

## Functionality
The app would take in user information (height, weight, eating habbits etc), and display how many calories the user should eat in a meal/day. The user would then be able to keep track of the information and inputting calories eaten, exercise done, and other useful information. If there is enough time, it would display the information in some sort of pretty graphics so the user can see the information easier.

## Library
From the gui and graphics libraries, I am thinking of using the ofxImGui library (https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxImGui) in order to help make the front end and the graphical side pretty for the user. I am also thinking of using the ofxDatGui library in order to make visuals about the given information (https://github.com/braitsch/ofxDatGui). By using these libraries, I am able to focus more on the actual functionality of the project while still having a cool visual aspect for my app

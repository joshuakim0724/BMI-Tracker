Day 1
Created a user class that will take in and store information about the user
1. Created getters
2. Created setters
3. Created methods to get information about calories
4. Started to create methods to input calorie information

Day 2
Tried to add library and trying to test if Git is updating correctly

ERROR (fixed): Library would not add correctly and main/opApp files were not implementing properly, not only that but main would not run with a bin error
SOLUTION: Went to office hours and we figured out that the library was not being exported into the open frameworks folder. Should work properly(?)

Day 3
1. Adding more methods for calories input
Messing around with library to figure out how it works

Day 4
Starting to get user input from boxes
Wanted to create a visual input but don't have the correct library for it so need to find one

Day 5
Created a constants class to hold all the magic variables
Added more inputs/buttons to the actual app

Day 6
Implemented the AddCalorie button
Created and implemented a label which shows total calories inputted
sdasd

Day 7
MAJOR PROBLEM: Accidently force pushed in terminal which removed all my previous commits
Had major errors committing, file references were all over the place, but after going to office hours and messing around a lot seems to be working.

Day 8
Having problems with exporting to a text file... Its not exporting or creating a text file because its not in the main method... not sure what to do atm.
- After doing a lot of research, I found a work around by directing the file path
Created more fileReader methods

Day 9
Realized some methods were working as intended, had to go fix them
Changed my gui a lot and adding more features.
